This interactive dashboard visualizes the relationship between life expectancy and GDP across different countries using the life expectancy dataset. Key features of the dashboard include:

* **Data Source**: Life expectancy dataset loaded from an online CSV file.
* **Interactive Scatter Plot**: Visualizes GDP against life expectancy, with bubble sizes representing population and colors indicating continents.
* **Continent Filter**: A dropdown menu allows users to filter data by continent, providing a focused view of specific regions.
* **Theme Selector**: A slider enables users to switch between different plot themes (e.g., plotly, plotly_dark, ggplot2, seaborn, simple_white) for customized visual styles.

The dashboard is built using Dash and Plotly, offering a user-friendly interface to explore and analyze the relationship between economic performance and health outcomes globally.
